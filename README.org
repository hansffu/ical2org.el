#+TITLE: ical2org.el

This library builds upon icalendar.el to get your calendar events into org mode.

* Config
You can define calendars to be imported like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq ical2org/calendars (list
                          (make-ical2org/calendar
                           :name "Personal calendar"
                           :org-file "/path/to/org/file"
                           :url "secret url to personal calendar")
                          (make-ical2org/calendar
                           :name "Work calendar"
                           :org-file "/path/to/org/file"
                           :url "secret url to work calendar")
                          ))
#+END_SRC
Note that the org file will be overwritten.
